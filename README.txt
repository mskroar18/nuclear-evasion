An Android application for determining proximity to likely nuclear targets (and effects). Florida addresses only. This application was a team project at FSU with 5 people. I created the idea, the design and data flow, content, and 3 of the fragments. USE: from launch enter an address (with city and state) or set location manually in Android Studio emulator. API 27 suggested (works almost perfectly at all levels above 16+). Select adversary (note: N. Korea has very few targets). Map window will launch showing location entered and closest nuclear detonation. Click on Shelters/Effects for more information about hazard zone and location map showing shelters (Federal national shelters). You can return to map from Effects/Shelters by clicking Return to Map. Click video for video showing possible effects from pop culture(movies).
